‚ú® Key Innovation: Zero-Shot Topic Modeling
To provide value beyond basic sentiment classification, this tool uses advanced Zero-Shot Classification for topic modeling.

Instead of just labeling feedback as "Negative" or "Positive," the model categorizes the feedback into specific, pre-defined business-relevant topics (e.g., "product quality," "customer support," "pricing"). This immediately transforms general feedback into actionable insights that product and service teams can use.
